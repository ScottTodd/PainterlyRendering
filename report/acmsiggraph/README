The "template.annotated.tex" file explains all of the parameters, definitions
and commands used in the "acmsiggraph" LaTeX class, and if you haven't used
this class before, it is recommended that you examine that file.

The "template.tex" file contains the same code as "template.annotated.tex" 
but none of the explanation.

Questions, comments and suggestions should be sent to Stephen Spencer
at 'spencer@cs.washington.edu' to be considered for inclusion in a future
version of this package.
